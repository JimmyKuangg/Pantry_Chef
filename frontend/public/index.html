      content="Pantry Chef is an app that is designed to give people suggestions on what to cook based on what they currently have. The app allows users to enter what they have within their own kitchens / pantries and generate recipes from our database that may have some or all of the ingredients that they currently have. User's can then save those ingredients to their own individual pantries for easier and faster searching next time. User's will also be able to create, edit, and share their own recipes with others on the site."
